# FHS-refactoring-hw2
Updated refactoring homework 1 for resubmission 

Refactoring actions:

> renamed page to be less generic 

> added alt notations for handicap/access use to images 

> shrink image file sizes so that pages load faster and push to repository takes less time 

> cleaned up the css file to create one class to replace the three separate repeating classes for the large images and text on the left of the page and similar action to replace the repeating classes for the benefits images and text on the right side of the page 

> fixed the links on the top of the page so they referenced the below sections properly for navigation to those areas of the page 

Here’s an image of the updated page
